# Basket Token

Our token is a basket token. The tokens that we have in our basket can be viewed by going to our Balancer Pool. The reason we use Balancer for our basket is that it does automatic dollar cost averaging. This leads to buying more of a token when it goes low and selling a token and distributing to other tokens, when a token goes high. The percents of each token held in the basket can be changed through governance.&#x20;
