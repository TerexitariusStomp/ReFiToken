The Powerledger token is available on Ethereum and is part of the Powerledger Blockchain. It has numerous utilities, including facilitating renewable energy trading. This version of Powerledger token does not have staking fees distributed to it, however it's in our roadmap to help Powerledger to create an Ethereum token that will be able to recieve staking fees. Once this token is in place, we will communicate with our community to see preference in switching Powerledger token to staked Powerledger token.&#x20;

The tokens will be the primary means of payment for items on their platform. Holding the tokens also improve the sale margin gained when shopping. Eventually IMPT will be used as a governance token.
