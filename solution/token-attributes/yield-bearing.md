# Yield Bearing

## Balancer Pool

Trading fees are earned based on the tokens in our Balancer Pool. As of 6/19/23 for 1 of the token pairs that will be in our pool[ Vita DAO and WETH](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0xbaeec99c90e3420ec6c1e7a769d2a856d2898e4d00020000000000000000008a)- there's a 28.18% - 69.81% APR. Around .43% of this comes from trading fees and the rest comes from Balancer Staking Incentives. We will work with Balancer to have our token be approved for staking incentives.&#x20;

## Tokens in Pool

Powerledger, Energy Web, Ethix are all tokens that generate yield when staked. However, for our Balancer Pool we need to ensure that the tokens deposited are always accessible by the people who deposited them. In a future development we will create tokens that will benefit from the staking systems of these platforms and likely switch these tokens with the non yield bearing ones in our pool.&#x20;
