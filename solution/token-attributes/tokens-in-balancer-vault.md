The Gitcoin Staked ETH Index (gtcETH) is an index token of the leading Ethereum liquid staking tokens. Fees benefit Gitcoin. This ETH earns staking rewards. There's a 2% fee on the rewards, 1.75% of that goes to Gitcoin and .25% of that goes to Index Coop (the creators of this token).&#x20;

### Powerledger

[Powerledger](https://www.powerledger.io/)’s technology enables players interacting on the grid to track, trace and trade renewable energy in real-time. This is helping to create a flexible power system that is both resilient and stable in the coming years. Powerledger now has projects in eleven countries across four continents.

The Powerledger token is available on Ethereum and is part of the Powerledger Blockchain. It has numerous utilities, including facilitating renewable energy trading. This version of Powerledger token does not have staking fees distributed to it, however it's in our roadmap to help Powerledger to create an Ethereum token that will be able to recieve staking fees. Once this token is in place, we will communicate with our community to see preference in switching Powerledger token to staked Powerledger token.&#x20;
