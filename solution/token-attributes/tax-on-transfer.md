# Tax on Transfer

There's a 1% tax on transfer of our token. 50% of this tax is used to buy our token and burn it. Permanently locking liquidity by burning the token. The other 50% is used to increase the amount of basket tokens held in the Balancer pool and thus giving back to our holders by increasing the amount they are able to claim beyond the value they originally deposited. &#x20;
