# Organizational Revenue Sources

## Balancer Trades

As pool owners we charge a 1% fee on trades that occur with our pool's liquidity. 50% of this gets channeled to us as an organization and 50% gets channeled back to our token holders.&#x20;

## Market Making

There will be large fluctuations in the pricing of our token. We will work with a market maker to benefit from these price fluctuations.&#x20;

## Transactions Requiring Gas on Our Site

From our website you'll be able to wrap and unwrap tokens, when this occurs gas is paid. An additional gas fee is placed on these actions which goes back to our organization.&#x20;
