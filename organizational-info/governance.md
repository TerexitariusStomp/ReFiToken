# Governance

Governance Rights

The organization will run in a centralized governance fashion, gradually decentralizing over time. Initially, the core team will be responsible for majority of governance and operational decisions.&#x20;

Voting Rights to DAO Members

Our MVP token will give holders the ability to vote on certain decisions. These decisions include what tokens are held as part of the Balancer pool and the percent of the Balancer pool that these tokens consist of. In order to add new tokens for consideration, a forum post needs to be made. This forum post will list details of the token and give our community the opportunity to discuss the pros and cons of adding this token to the Balancer pool.  &#x20;

Passing a Vote

If a decision comes to vote, >51% of tokens voting for the proposal over a week timeframe means the decision goes through. Anything less than 51% means that the proposal does not pass. Voting will be done on our Snapshot.&#x20;

Selection Criteria for DAO Members

Anyone is able to buy the token on a decentralized exchange and gain governance rights to certain decisions. On our website based upon legal consideration, we say who is able to interact with our token. However, it is up to individuals to comply with laws and regulations pertinent to them.&#x20;

Process of Decentralization

Current governance power has been created for deciding on Balancer Tokens included in the pool as well as percents of each token held in the pool. Additional voting decisions will be created as the core team decides. This will be a gradual decentralization process that may involve the creation of separate working groups that take lead on such governance decisions (such as roadmap development, marketing strategies etc.). There's no set times currently as to when certain governance decisions will be able to be decentralized or not.

Treasury&#x20;

The main treasury(s) of our organization will be kept in a multi signature smart contract safe- such as [https://safe.global/](https://safe.global/)&#x20;
