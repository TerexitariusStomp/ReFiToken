# Fundraising Mechanism

We are fundraising for our organization in both tokens and equity. However our primary fundraising mechanism is tokens.

## Value Increase&#x20;

The investment vehicle gives exposure to regenerative finance projects in our Balancer Pool. These ReFi projects grow in value over time based upon what they are creating as an organization. Along with that the transaction fees from trades on Balancer DEX enables rewards benefitting the token, a similar Balancer Pool (that's incentivized by Balancer) receives around 28% APR. A 1% tax on transactions with our token enable us to further increase the value of our token over time, by providing further liquidity and burning.
