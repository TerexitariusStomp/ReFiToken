# Why Web3

The regenerative finance tokens we are creating pools with are not available on web2. Web3 allows us to create pools of these tokens, do automatic dollar cost averaging of them, and benefit from trades of these tokens done on Balancer.

## Web3 Strategy

Ethereum is a fantastic first chain to start this project on. Not only are big name regenerative finance projects on it, but also a lot of active traders. The organization will start out centralized at first and then working towards decentralization. As the index solution could be implemented on additional chains the interoperability component is noted and it is included in our whitepaper [further-blockchains.md](../roadmap/further-blockchains.md "mention").&#x20;
