# Impact

Agriculture and Food, Energy Generation and Storage, Carbon Neutralization and Removal, As further regenerative finance projects demonstrate success in other areas we can include them in our project.

## Measuring Impact

We will measure impact through the amount of each token we’ve been able to lock as well as the average volume maintained of the token. This will be for each token as well as the tokens related sustainable development goal category. Along with that we will keep track of the daily, weekly, monthly and yearly percent gain of the token as well as the token’s expected APY.&#x20;
