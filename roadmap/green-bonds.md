# Green Bonds

Debt financing of environmental projects is needed. For beginning environmental projects- individuals or organizations, they rarely have enough credit or assets collected to acquire funding. In order to finance these projects, alternative funding sources are needed.

## Self Repaying Loans

With our loan system we borrow from the concept that [Alchemix](https://alchemix-finance.gitbook.io/user-docs/how-to/take-a-self-repaying-loan) created of self repaying loans. Our token has yield bearing mechanisms built into it.  People can provide borrowing liquidity, and either borrow further funds themselves or benefit from when others borrow from the liquidity. When collateralized borrowers can borrow up to 50% of the collateral value. If the borrower keeps the loan amount and continues to utilize it- with a estimated 20% yield of our token, the loan pays itself off in around 5 years.&#x20;

## Uncollateralized Loans&#x20;

## Establishing Credit

[Union Finance](https://docs.union.finance/) is the leading organization that has developed a credit mechanism on chain. It utilizes social networks to establish credibility of a borrower. People that vouch for a borrower, could have a percent of their funds lost if the borrower defaults. After the launch of our token, we will be building a community. This community will be tied to environmental projects throughout the world. We will collaborate with Union Finance to establish a way in which we can establish credibility of borrowers for environmental projects.&#x20;

## Loan Origination&#x20;

From our revenue we develop a community treasury. This treasury is the basis from which uncollateralized loans are financed. We use a quadratic funding principle for offering uncolateralized loans. The more vouches you get from the community, the higher the amount you're able to borrow. Currently only one loan at a time is available to a borrower.&#x20;

## Loan MVP

Once we have our loan MVP established, the first uncollateralized projects we will provide financing to [are farms on Ethichub](https://app.ethichub.com/projects) ([or through staking](https://ethix.ethichub.com/stake)).
