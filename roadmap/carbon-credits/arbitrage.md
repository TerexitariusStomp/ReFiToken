# Arbitrage

Swaps of external tokens (such as loyalty points) for micro carbon credits decreases the supply of micro carbon credits in the HOPE liquidity pools and increases the value of a micro carbon credit (hence increasing the value of a carbon credit). Once the value has risen enough in comparison to the credits on other blockchains, it can trigger people to bridge more credits from the other blockchains to HOPE. Once the credits have been bridged and supply increases in the liquidity pool, the value of the credits drops, until it reaches an equivalent price as the other blockchains. It is not expected that the value of the credits will drop below the value of the credits on other blockchains, as it would not be of financial benefit for people to bridge their credits (they would have a lesser value).
