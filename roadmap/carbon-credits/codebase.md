Why Not Create Your Own Codebase?

Being able to tap into the supply of credits brought on chain require a bridge from those chains (like polygon) to HOPE. However around USD $960,000,000 were stolen in the first quarter of 2022 from bridge hacks (4). In order to have limited liability for if this attack occurs to our bridge, we need to partner with existing bridge communities. Out of Connext, Multichain, Router Protocol, and Wormhole. The two that have been hacked so far are Multichain and Wormhole. Router Protocol is still in its infancy and only has 3 verifiers currently. This leaves Connext as the bridge community to partner with. Connext currently has grants available for non-EVM integrations.
