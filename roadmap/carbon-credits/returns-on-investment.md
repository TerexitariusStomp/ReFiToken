# Returns on Investment

Currently we are in discussions with an organization that has the ability to offset USD $500,000 a day through their customers. As HOPE uses Klima as its base it benefits from its underlying liquidity pools. Klima owns 92.5% of the liquidity pool of Toucan and 40.43% of the liquidity pool of Moss (5,6,7). For each transaction that occurs on liquidity pools, 0.3% of that transaction is charged as a fee. 0.25% of that is sent to liquidity pool holders as rewards (8). Hope used .0025% of the total wsKlima supply to create its tokens.

&#x20;This means every day that the HOPE offsets USD $500,000, anywhere from $2.83 to $1.24 will be gathered and distributed amongst all HOPE token holders (($500,000\*.25%)_92.5% or 40.43%)_.0025%). This equates to $1,035 to $452 annually. This estimate is for when we are the only entity trading on chain carbon credits which are tied to Klima, which we are not. There is an entire ecosystem of tokens building synergies between each other in the carbon credit market. Right now, Klima has a 289 day runway for distributing rewards to holders at a 400% APY (5). Along with that we will establish partnerships beyond this organization to be able to offset even more value through HOPE.
