# Klima's Role

Klima currently is benefiting from transactions of carbon tokens on the polygon network, through token bonds. HOPE tokens can be minted through bridging wsKlima (a token that benefits from staking of Klima) to HOPE. wsKlima doesnâ€™t increase in tokens, unlike sKlima, until unwrapped. As Klima is looking to try and be a blackhole for carbon credits it is likely that any carbon credits brought on chain will eventually be linked to Klima. As HOPE increases the buying of these credits (fees accumulated to Klima), it can directly be benefited through what Klima has built so far. In order for holders to redeem their HOPE for wsKlima it would need to be brought over to Polygon, then unwrapped. At that point all the accumulated sKlima will be available and with unstaking the sKlima can be traded for other values.
