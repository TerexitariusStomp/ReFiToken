# Sourcing Carbon Credits

In the web2 space there is a lack of transparency for how much of a supply is available from what organizations and how much that supply costs. Bridges have already formed that have brought carbon credits on chain, specifically the polygon blockchain. These bridges have been created by Toucan (BCT, NCT), Moss (MCO2), C3 and others. Toucan alone has successfully bridged 25 million carbon credits on chain. Building a bridge to these on chain carbon credits to HOPEarth enables us to dynamically channel these credits and send them efficiently in small units.
