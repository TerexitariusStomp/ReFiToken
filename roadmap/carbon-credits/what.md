# What

Gas fees range from $15 (Ethereum) to small amounts like $0.002 (Polygon) per transaction.

However, when a transaction has a value less than the gas cost (for example less than $0.002) then what happens?

&#x20;The transaction is delayed and accumulated or it is bundled with other transactions until an amount greater than that of the gas cost is reached.

Unless there's an alternative solution.
