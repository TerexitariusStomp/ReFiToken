# DEX Token

In most DEXâ€™s liquidity providers create liquidity through bonding two tokens together. However, when doing this the liquidity providers are subject to impermanent loss. Balancer pioneered an approach that allowed liquidity providers to continue to earn rewards without being exposed to impermanent loss. The main answer was to have one of the tokens being bonded in the liquidity pool be the token of the DEX, in this case HOPE token. People then provide the other side of the bond, in this context carbon credits or other tokens. As more people provide liquidity in the HOPE DEX, more HOPE tokens are locked up. People that have HOPE tokens locked up receive a proportional amount of locked HOPE tokens, this token allows the individual to participate in the governance of HOPE.
