# Bridging

[Connext ](https://www.connext.network/)is one of the leading bridge providers for blockchains. Our aim is to collaborate with them to create a bridge between Polygon and HOPEarth for carbon credits. The bridging of these credits can be done by a decentralized community interested in arbitraging between the different ecosystems (Polygon and HOPEarth). When bridged over the credit ownership is retained by the entity that bridged it.
