# Codebase

Balancer has been making extensive progress in automated market makers and decentralized exchanges since they were invented. [Their codebase ](https://balancer.fi/whitepaper.pdf)is open source and able to be adapted to this use case.

Another potential codebase is [GooseFX](https://docs.goosefx.io/goosefx-platform-features/ss-liquidity-provisioning).

Note: There is a great deal of possible flexibility in the design as the implementation needs to be built more or less from scratch, as to be economically viable the DEX cannot rely on solutions built on ledgered blockchains.
