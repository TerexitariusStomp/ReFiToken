# Micro Carbon Credits

Why do we need to send transactions less than $0.002?

&#x20;A vehicle emits around 4.6 metric tons of COâ‚‚ per year (1). The current cost of carbon credits on the blockchain are anywhere from $2- $6.10 (2, 3). That means to offset a car for a year it would cost anywhere from $10-$25. However, with HOPEarth the objective is to dynamically offset every kilometer driven during the year (an average of around 18,507 km (1)). That means for a single driver, 18,507 transactions at a value of $0.0005 to $0.001. At the maximum value of this transaction it is still half the value of the polygon gas fee.
