# Other Tokens

Creators of other tokens are responsible for maintaining their value in relation to the carbon credit as well as the Sato-Servers that contain the tokens. Sato-Servers that contain tokens when bonded in the DEX will accumulate Sato-Servers within the DEX. In order for the token creators to get the Sato-Servers back they need to buy the Tokens and Sato-Servers from the DEX.
