# Liquidity Pools

All tokens connected to the HOPEarth ecosystem have relative values to each other based upon liquidity pools. For example, 1 carbon credit token is equivalent to the value of 1 million micro carbon credit tokens, but the value of micro carbon credits can vary depending on trades in the liquidity pools containing them. Through these pools, these carbon credits are also tied to the value of other tokens in the ecosystem. The central token which all other tokens value are tied to is the liquidity token of the DEX, the HOPE token.
