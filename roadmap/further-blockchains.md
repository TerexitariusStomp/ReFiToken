# Further Blockchains

Our first token will be created on Ethereum (A). Once this MVP has been proven we will move to other blockchains (like Polygon (B), Optimism, etc.). Once MVPs for each of these chains are established, we will bridge tokens to other chains- for example Ethereum (A) token bridged to Polygon (B). After successful bridging, we will then create a new token (C). This token will be a combo of the tokens. Such as a singular token (C) that represents the tokens on both Ethereum (A) and Polygon (B). After the combo of two blockchain tokens are proven, we will bridge all blockchains together (E) creating a singular ecosystem token (D).&#x20;

_Numbers represent individual tokens, A is Ethereum, B is Polygon, C is a single token of both A and B, E is all other blockchains and D is an ecosystem token._&#x20;
