# Yield Bearing Token Generation

Ethix, Powerledger, Energy Web etc. are all example tokens that could be benefiting from yield generation. Unfortunately due to their current setup, they are not. We will be working with these organizations to create yield tokens that can then be substituted for the tokens in our Balancer Pool that aren't generating yield.&#x20;

## Create a Boosted Balancer Pool

Another way we could enable yield generating tokens to benefit from yield while included in the Balancer pool, is through creating a boosted Balancer pool. Currently Aave yield generating tokens are examples of this, we'll work with Balancer to identify the possibility of having this occur for other non-Aave projects.&#x20;
